This requires mongodb, pymongo, and webpy are installed.

mkdir db
Run an instance of mongodb with mongdb --dbpath=db

After install those packages, the system can be setup with the following
commands.   Note that each of these steps takes awhile the first time, but 
will then updates incrementally, and only has do work to process new data.

python update_loop.py

Then run

python frontend_local.py     # starts webserver running on localhost:8080

To get adequate performance for the search page from the webserver, 
you need to make sure that there are indicies for players and kingdom cards.

mongo
MongoDB shell version: 1.6.6-pre-
> connecting to: test
> db.games.ensureIndex({players: 1})
> db.games.ensureIndex({supply: 1})
