    This contains a very poor interface to card winning stats that depend
    on having up to two other cards available in the supply.

    <ul>
      <li><b>Availability</b>:  The number of games in which the card is 
        present, multiplied by the number of players in each game. 
        It represents the number of "decks" that could have purchased 
        that card.
      <li><b>%+</b>: Percentage of times the named card was gained at 
        least once.
      <li><b>Per Gain</b>: This is win rate on the card on a per gain basis.
        If player 1 bought the card 5 times and won, and player 2 bought the 
        card 3 times and lost, then this would count as 5 wins and 3 losses
        in two player games, giving a win rate of 5 * 2 / (5 + 3) =
        10 / 8 = 1.25.  
      <li><b>Any Gain</b>: This is a win rate that does not include multiple
        gains of a card in the same game.  In the above 5 winning vs 3 losing
        example, the card would have a win rate of 1, because both players
        purchased it.
      <li><b>Num Gained</b>: The average number of the card gained per player.
    </ul>
